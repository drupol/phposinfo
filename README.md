# PHP OS Info

## Description

Get information of the current operating system where PHP is running on.

Information that you can retrieve are:

* Operating system name
* Operating system family
* Machine UUID

There are many packages that does that already, but most of them are based on
the use of the variable `PHP_OS` that contains the operating system name PHP was
built on, from [php.net](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php):

     The operating system PHP was built for.

However, `PHP_OS` might be sometimes not very accurate, then using
[php_uname()](https://php.net/php_uname) might be a better fit for detecting the
operating system, we only use it as a fallback.

This library uses [php_uname()](https://php.net/php_uname) and a static list of
existing operating systems, and then from there, tries to deduct the operating
system family.

From PHP 7.2, the variable `PHP_OS_FAMILY` was added and based on the definition
from [php.net](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.constants.php):

     The operating system family PHP was built for.
     Either of 'Windows', 'BSD', 'Darwin', 'Solaris', 'Linux' or 'Unknown'.

So once again, if you're using a PHP which is cross compiled, using those
constant is a bad idea.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.1.3

## Installation

```composer require drupol/phposinfo```

## Usage

```php
<?php

include 'vendor/autoload.php';

use drupol\phposinfo\OsInfo;
use drupol\phposinfo\Enum\Family;
use drupol\phposinfo\Enum\Os;

// Register constants if they do not exists:
// * PHP_OS_FAMILY
// * PHP_OS
// * PHPOSINFO_OS_FAMILY
// * PHPOSINFO_OS
OsInfo::register();

// Get the OS name.
OsInfo::os();

// Get the OS family.
OsInfo::family();

// Check if the OS is Unix based.
OsInfo::isUnix();

// Check if the OS is Apple based.
OsInfo::isApple();

// Check if the OS is Windows based.
OsInfo::isWindows();

// Check the OS version.
OsInfo::version();

// Check the OS release.
OsInfo::release();

// Check if the OS Family is Family::UNIX_ON_WINDOWS.
OsInfo::isFamily(Family::UNIX_ON_WINDOWS);

// Check if the OS is Os::FREEBSD.
OsInfo::isOs(Os::FREEBSD);

// Check if the OS is Windows.
OsInfo::isOs('windows');

// Check if the OS family is darwin.
OsInfo::isFamily('darwin');

// Get the machine UUID.
OsInfo::uuid();
```

## Code quality, tests and benchmarks

Every time changes are introduced into the library, [Github actions](https://github.com/drupol/phposinfo/actions) are setup
to test the library against different operating systems and PHP versions.

The library has tests written with [PHPSpec](http://www.phpspec.net/).
Feel free to check them out in the `spec` directory. Run `composer phpspec` to trigger the tests.

Before each commit some inspections are executed with [GrumPHP](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp), run `./vendor/bin/grumphp run` to check manually.

[PHPInfection](https://github.com/infection/infection) is used to ensure that your code is properly tested, run `composer infection` to test your code.
